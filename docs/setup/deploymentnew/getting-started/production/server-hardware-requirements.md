# Server Hardware Requirements

## Overview

MOSIP deployment is split into two distinct parts:

1. [ID lifecycle management](../../../../id-lifecycle-management/)
   * Pre-registration
   * Registration
2. [ID Authentication](../../../../id-lifecycle-management/identity-verification/id-authentication.md)

The server-side hardware estimates for the above are specified at a high level in terms of **compute** (Virtual CPU, RAM) and **storage** requirements. We provide estimates for [MOSIP core modules](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/release-1.2.0/deployment/v3/mosip) only. [External components](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/release-1.2.0/deployment/v3/external) are not in the scope. See [Exclusions](server-hardware-requirements.md#exclusions).

The variables that largely determine the hardware requirements are:

1. The population of the country
2. Rate of enrolment
3. Usage of foundation ID by various services

## Pre-registration

Refer to [Pre-registration Resource Calculator XLS](../../../../_files/pre-reg-resource-calculator-v2.xlsx)

Allow for 20% additional compute and storage for monitoring and any overheads.

## Registration (enrolment)

The registration compute resources are related to the max rate of enrolment desired. The processing throughput must match the enrolment rate to avoid a pile-up of pending registration packets.

The data here is based on actual field data of a MOSIP deployment.

Assumptions:

* Rate of enrolment: 216000 per day
* Average packet size: 2MB
* Biometric modalities: Finger, iris, face
* Pod replication as given here. (TBD)

### Compute requirements for registration

* Configuration of compute node: 12 VCPU, 64GB RAM, 64GB disk store.
* Number of nodes: 21

| Resource       | Per node | Nodes |    Total |
| -------------- | -------: | ----: | -------: |
| VCPU           |       12 |    21 |  **252** |
| RAM (GB)       |       64 |    21 | **1344** |
| Node disk (GB) |       64 |    21 | **1344** |

### Storage requirements for registration

Storage is dependent on the population of a country (i.e. the number of UINs to be issued). Storage requirements for various types of data are listed below.
