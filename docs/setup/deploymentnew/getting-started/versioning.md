# Versioning

The following versioning conventions are followed for repos related to deployment:

* [`mosip-infra`](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra) branch == MOSIP release version == [`mosip-helm`](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-helm) branch.
* [`k8s-infra`](https://github.com/mosip/k8s-infra) is on `main` branch.
* [Helm chart version](versioning.md#glossary) \~= [MOSIP release version](versioning.md#glossary) but with following versioning convention:
  * MOSIP release version: `w.x.y.z`. Example `1.2.0.1`
  * Helm chart version: `wx.y.z`. Example `12.0.1` (as Helm follows 3 digit versioning).
  * In case of `develop` branch of `mosip-helm` `version` in `Chart.yaml` points to next planned release version of MOSIP (as Helm does not allow version like `develop`).
* [Docker image tag](versioning.md#glossary) in `values.yaml` of Helm chart == MOSIP release version.
* Helm charts contain default compatible docker image tag.
* `appVersion` field in `Charts.yaml` is not used.
