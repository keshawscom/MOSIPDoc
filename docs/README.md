## About MOSIP

The **Modular Open Source Identity Platform** is an open-source, open standards-based foundational identity platform. MOSIP is an API-first platform that can be used by countries to build their own national ID platform. MOSIP offers [ID Lifecycle Management](id-lifecycle-management/) features and identity verification capabilities out of the box. Conceived to help build global digital public goods in the space of digital identification and governance, MOSIP is anchored at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore ([IIIT-B](https://www.iiitb.ac.in)). It harnesses the power of open-source technologies and embraces the best practices of scalability, security and privacy. [Learn more >>](https://www.mosip.io)
