### Major Highlights

#### New Features include: &#x20;

1. **Migrated to Java 21:**&#x20;

* Migrated the Api Test Commons library from Java 11 to Java 21&#x20;
* Removed “kernel-registration-packet-manager” and “kernel-crypto-jce” libraries as these are not compatible with Java 21 migration and implemented crypto core class inside the apitest commons for encrypt and decrypt utils&#x20;
* Removed automatic dependency injection added for adopting crypto core class from “kernel-crypto-jce” library&#x20;

2. **Array Handles:**&#x20;

* Added functionality to generate and update the request body with an array of handles for Identity API to create the UIN through the Id-Repository module &#x20;
* Refer to [Swagger Link](https://api-internal.qa-plan.mosip.net/idrepository/v1/identity/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/idrepository/v1/identity/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/id-repo-controller) for api details, change the environment as per requirement in the URL &#x20;

3. **Skip and Report known Issues/Failures:**&#x20;

* Implementation of skipping the testcases for the known issues/failures with the bug that will be fixed in the future.&#x20;
* Skipped details will be displayed in the report&#x20;

4. **Component Base URL’s:**&#x20;

* Added logic to handle dependent services, allowing them to run in different environments based on Base URLs provided in the configuration property&#x20;

5. **Unique Identifier:** &#x20;

* Introducing the unique identifier and mapping with the master testcase sheet for easy accessibility of the testcases between the api testrig and the master testcase sheet which helps to easily identify the api testrig failed testcases in the master testcase sheet&#x20;
* Displaying the unique identifier in the report&#x20;

6. **Context URL:**&#x20;

* Now, the backward compatibility for the mimoto context URL&#x20;

/residentmobileapp à /v1/mimoto has been implemented.&#x20;

7. **Storing Reports in Mount/ Configured Path:**&#x20;

* Added flexibility for storing the Test reports in either an S3 bucket or mounted path.
* The config property used “push-reports-to-s3” is No.&#x20;
* The configured mount volume path is “/home/mosip/testrig/report”.
* Helps when the service is deployed in non-MOSIP environments.

8. **WebSocket util:**&#x20;

* Created the util class for creating the connection and sending the message through WebSocket to support the KYC process testing&#x20;

### Enhancements&#x20;

1. **Report Generation:**&#x20;

* Enhanced the reporting module to provide more detailed and comprehensive reports, improving the visibility and traceability of test results.&#x20;

2. **Restructured Config Manager:**&#x20;

* Restructured config manager to hold only the common configurations in apitest commons and moved the module specific properties to the respective modules&#x20;

3. **Removed Component Specific Code:**&#x20;

* Moved the module specific implementations from apitest commons to the respective modules.
* Moved the suite setup into respective modules test runner class.

4. **Generic DB Manager:**&#x20;

* Optimized DB manager by removing the module specific code and making it more generic&#x20;
* Module specific DB execution implementations are moved to respective modules&#x20;

5. **Renamed the Classes:**&#x20;

* MockSMTPListener class in the “io.mosip.testrig.apirig.testrunner” package is renamed to OTPListener as this class is used to listen to the OTP from the Mock SMTP&#x20;

6. **Mock MDS:**&#x20;

* Modified the quality score data type to be compatible with Java 21 migrated mock MDS library&#x20;

### Bug fixes
