## Overview

This release is a 0.9.1 release of Resident Services, offering valuable insights into the range of features and functionality available. Resident Services is designed to run on the 1.2.0.1 version of the MOSIP platform. Resident Services are the self-services that are used by the residents themselves via a portal. [Resident Portal](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/resident-services/resident-portal-user-guide) is a web-based UI application that provides residents of a country with services related to their Unique Identification Number (UIN).
