Resident Services is designed to run on the 1.2.0.1 version of the MOSIP platform. Resident Services are the self-services that the residents themselves use via a portal. [Resident Portal](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/resident-services/resident-portal-user-guide) is a web-based UI application that provides residents of a country with services related to their Unique Identification Number (UIN).
