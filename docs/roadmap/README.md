# üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

The MOSIP community strives to deliver major [releases](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/releases) as per the designated schedules, while offering minor releases every other month! The roadmap outlines the vision, goals, and planned development milestones of all our ongoing and upcoming projects over a specific period of time. It also provides a high-level overview of the MOSIP platform's future direction, features, enhancements, and major updates.

MOSIP has been developed with a focus on addressing challenges related to identity management, privacy, security, and data protection. It is designed to offer flexibility and modularity, allowing governments to tailor identity systems according to their unique requirements.

[MOSIP's principles](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/roadmap#principles-and-vision), as outlined below, underpin the design and development of the roadmap.\
The year-wise roadmap details how these principles will be applied and advanced in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that the digital ID platform evolves in alignment with these core principles.

Head below to navigate through our year-wise roadmap that provides a strategic overview of the journey ahead and highlights the key milestones & objectives for each year!

## Principles and Vision

MOSIP is based on several key principles that guide its development and implementation. These principles are closely related to the roadmap in the following ways:

* **Modularity**: One of MOSIP's core principles is modularity, which means breaking down the digital ID system into smaller, interoperable components. This relates to the roadmap by ensuring that the roadmap outlines the development and integration of these modular components over time.
* **Open Source**: MOSIP is an open-source platform, and this principle emphasizes transparency and community involvement. The roadmap reflects this by detailing how the open-source community will be engaged and how contributions from various stakeholders will be incorporated into the project.
* **Interoperability**: MOSIP places a strong emphasis on interoperability, ensuring that digital IDs can work seamlessly across various systems and organizations. The roadmap describes how interoperability will be achieved and expanded in different phases.
* **Privacy and Security**: MOSIP prioritizes privacy and security in digital ID systems. The roadmap outlines the steps and technologies that will be implemented to enhance privacy and security measures over time.
* **Scalability**: The platform is designed to be scalable, accommodating the growth of users and services. The roadmap includes the plans for scaling the system as needed and adapting to changing requirements.
* **Inclusivity**: MOSIP aims to be inclusive, providing digital IDs to all individuals, including marginalized and underserved populations. The roadmap describes strategies for reaching and serving these populations effectively.

MOSIP's principles underpin the design and development of the roadmap. The year-wise roadmap details how these principles will be applied and advanced in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that the digital ID platform evolves in alignment with these core principles.

Below is an illustration of some of the key features and principles upon which the MOSIP solution has been envisioned.
