{% hint style="success" %}
**Prerequisites:**

The resident is registered with a username and password using eSignet's Signup portal. In the below demo application, we are using resident's phone number as username. {% endhint %}


1\. On the portal, the resident clicks on the button **Sign In with eSignet**.

The login screen appears, and the resident is displayed with the options they can choose for login.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**\
If the `acr_values` query parameter is presented with only one `acr` in the authorize URL, then the login options page is skipped, and resident is directly taken to the login page.
{% endhint %}

2\. The resident needs to enter a registered username in the **Enter 8â€“9-digit mobile number** and password in the **Enter password** text field and check the box 'I'm not a robot'.

The password-based authentication is secured with a captcha.

Note:&#x20;

* Login with password form also has link **Sign Up With Unified Login** to navigate to the Signup portal, if the resident is still not registered.
* **Forgot password** link is also available for resident to navigate to signup portal to reset the password.
* Resident can resume back login after successful registration as well as after successful reset of password.
{% endhint %}

5\. The resident is then navigated to the Consent page. On this page, the **Essential** and **Voluntary** claims are displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consent screen is presented solely to the resident if consent has not previously been obtained. Additionally, a timer is incorporated into the Consent screen, allowing the resident to provide a response within the designated time frame. In the event that the allotted time elapses, residents will be redirected to the relying party user interface.
{% endhint %}

6\. The resident should now click the **Allow** button. The system navigates the resident to the **User Profile** page which displays all the personal information based on the consent provided.
